<h1>About Shift the Subsidies - National</h1>

<p>The <b>Shift the Subsidies - National</b> database is an interactive tool to visually track and analyze the amount of public money at the national and subnational levels supporting oil, gas and coal development.</p> 
	
<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Every year, some $775 billion or more in subsidies around the world go towards supporting fossil fuels. In a time of economic hardship, dangerous climate change, and growing demand for reliable and cleaner sources of energy, these fossil fuel subsidies are a reckless and irrational use of taxpayer money and government investments.</p>

<p>In part recognizing this fact, global leaders from over 50 countries have made public commitments to phase out these subsidies in the “medium term”… but as with many commitments political leaders make, these have gone unfulfilled. Governments are busy hiding their subsidies and feigning activity, while billions of dollars are wasted, the atmosphere gets filled with greenhouse gas emissions and the planet burns.</p>

<p>The most egregious of these subsidies are production and exploration subsidies - those subsidies that pour more money into expanding already lucrative industries that thrive on further polluting our planet. According to the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and others, more than two-thirds of currently proven fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground in order to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. Given this increasingly scientifically-accepted reality, continuing to put public money into the expansion of the oil, gas and coal industries is unpardonable.</p> 

<p>By tracking subsidies to oil, gas and coal at the national level, this database is designed to arm you with information to encourage national, state, and provincial governments to Shift the Subsidies from dirty to clean energy.</p>

<h2>Who is responsible for the database?</h2> 

<p><a href="http://staydiligent.com/">Oil Change International</a> is responsible for the development and maintenance of the Shift the Subsidies database. <a href="http://staydiligent.com/">Diligent Creative</a> designed and developed the Shift the Subsidies database and website.</p>

<h2>What data is included in the database?</h2> 

<p>The information included in the Shift the Subsidies - National database currently relies heavily on oil, gas and coal subsidy information from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which tracks fossil fuel subsidies in 34 countries.</p> 

<p>Using the data available from the OECD, Oil Change International has reviewed the subsidies, sometimes reclassifying them to showcase exploration, production and consumption subsidies, and converting the subsidy amounts provided to U.S. dollars. If currency conversion is required, the U.S. dollar amount is calculated based on the exchange rate on December 31 of the approval year, using the rates published on <a href="http://www.x-rates.com/historical/">X-Rates</a>.</p>

<p>Oil Change International has further reviewed and added data from additional sources in several key countries:</p> 
<ul>
<li>United States: Oil Change has completed additional research on U.S. fossil fuel subsidies, and various sources have been added to the OECD data.</li>
<li>Indonesia: Oil Change has completed original research on coal subsidies in Indonesia.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further research on production subsidies is forthcoming on fossil fuel subsidies, particularly those for exploration and production, in G20 countries.</p>
