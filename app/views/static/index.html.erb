	<div id="intro">
		<p>For decades, wealthy countries have been using international aid and other foreign assistance&mdash;through grants, loans, equity and loan guarantees&mdash;to subsidize the expansion of the international fossil fuel industry.</p> 
		<p>The <b>Shift the Subsidies</b> database is an interactive tool to visually track and analyze the flow of energy subsidies from international, regional and bilateral public financial institutions around the world.</p>
		<p>The database currently tracks subsidies from the World Bank Group from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2011 and major regional development banks from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2010. In the future, we will also add bilateral aid from major governments.</p>
