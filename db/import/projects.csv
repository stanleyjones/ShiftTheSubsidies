The loan is one of the cornerstones of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY08-11 which fully integrates the Bank's activities for FY08-11 into the Government's ninth development plan. Measures undertaken by the Turkish administration and supported under the program are expected to contribute to sustaining the growth experienced by Turkey since 2002, generating employment, supporting the competitiveness of Turkish industry, and improving the living standards of its people. The program carries several risks. From the macroeconomic side, Turkey faces economic challenges as a result of the global financial crisis. In particular, high external financing needs, mainly in the private sector, make Turkey vulnerable to persisting international illiquidity and capital outflows. While a single-party Government with a strong parliamentary majority creates a favorable environment for reform, some political risks to the program remain, including: (i) continuing domestic political differences; and (ii) geopolitical events in neighboring regions. On the program side, all PEDPL-1 supported reforms have been implemented, and the risk of reversal is low. However, there are sector specific risks: delays in implementation of the remaining envisaged reforms, delays in attracting private investment, slow progress of energy efficiency measures contributing to continuing high electricity demand growth, and external developments that result in the policy actions failing to achieve a significant level of improvement in the electricity supply demand imbalance","","","","Oil and Gas"

Mali still has a very low rural electrification access rate. According to the National Directorate of Energy (DNE), in 2007 only about 17 percent of the population has access to electricity. In urban areas the access rate is about 30 percent and it is about 7 percent in rural areas. These low access rates are not allowing Mali to fully harness its economic potentials to compete fairly on international markets. Most rural households meet their lighting and small power needs with kerosene, dry cell, and car batteries. They do not have any form of modern energy for lighting or for operating equipment. This additional financing is intended to mainly finance energy services delivery sub-projects (both bottom up and top down) consistent with its initial development objective. The successful experience of the spontaneous bottom up projects under HEURA has demonstrated the potential for energy services delivery schemes in rural Mali led by local private operators. This experience needs to be sustained by adequate and predictable financing to avoid loosing the momentum created.

Despite enormous challenges, the Palestinian Authority (PA) continues to make strides towards creating the structure of a future Palestinian State. However, during the past several years the political process has stagnated and there has been little visible progress towards a long-term peace settlement. As a consequence, the economy has continued to deteriorate with low investment, the productive base hollowing out and per capita Gross Domestic product (GDP) declining. GDP levels are only maintained through massive inflows of foreign aid that has propped up consumption and government spending. Despite this, the PA, with generous support from the international community, has moved ahead with creating the institutional structures required to provide needed services to the Palestinian people. The World Bank's ongoing technical assistance and budget support has been instrumental to these efforts, especially in helping the PA mobilize the international assistance needed to fund their operations. Regular and consistent external support is required to maintain momentum and World Bank assistance is viewed by all donors as a strong indication that the PA is fulfilling its commitments and deserves continued funding.","","","","Policy Loan - Other"

The proposed project consists of the construction and operation of 2x165MWe circulated fluidized bed (CFB) technology thermal power units in northern Chile to be fired by a combination of coal, petroleum coke, and biomass fuels. The project sponsor is Suez Energy Andino (project sponsor), a subsidiary of Suez S.A. (France). The first 165MWe unit (Unit 1) is to be developed by Central Termoeléctrica Andina S.A., (CTA), while the second 165MWe unit (Unit 2), with essentially the same characteristics, will be developed through a separate special purpose company. Both Unit 1 and 2 will be selling power to the spot market. To hedge the exposure against spot market volatility, Unit 1 already signed a 21-year financial contract or power purchase agreement (PPA) with Corporación Nacional del Cobre S.A. (Codelco), a Chilean state-owned copper mining company, for 150 MW capacity sales. Furthermore, with respect to Units 1 and 2, CTA entered into a turn-key contract with Cobra Instalaciones y Servicios S.A. (Cobra), a company of ACS S.A. (Spain). Notice to proceed to the EPC contractor for the construction of the first unit (165 MW) was issued on July 1, 2007 and for the second unit on December 31, 2007. The construction period is expected to take 33 months. With respect to Unit 2, the PPA arrangements are yet to be finalized. The total project cost for the two units is estimated at about $1 billion.

The project's main impact will be to prevent a possible catastrophe resulting from a dam failure. Such a catastrophe can result in significant loss of life and damage to property of persons living in downstream areas. It will also cause a major and prolonged fall in hydropower production that will severely affect the entire population of Albania and will likely significantly increase electricity prices in the whole South East Europe (SEE) region. Poor and vulnerable people in the region will likely suffer disproportionately from any such electricity price increases. The project consists of two main components: (1) physical infrastructure investments; and (2) technical assistance. Physical infrastructure investments include: (i) the specification and implementation of water alarm systems in the Drin and Mat River basins, and specification of an Emergency Action Plan; (ii) rehabilitation of spillways on Fierza, Koman and Vau i Dejes dams on the Drin river; (iii) rehabilitation of electromechanical equipment in the Koman dam; and (iv) implementation of Load Frequency Control system in Vau i Dejes and Fierza Dams.

The project will displace the use of light fuel oil in diesel engine driven generators operated by the Guyana Power and Light Company (GPL), the national utility, in the Berbice region. As the utility currently has insufficient capacity, there is extensive use of self-generation by industry and households. The project will also displace a significant amount of this unregulated and inefficient self-generation as confidence in reliable supply is progressively built over time. The cogeneration plant will use bagasse from the sugar factory during the cane crop seasons, and will be equipped with diesel generating capacity for co-firing fuel oil during off-crop periods when bagasse stocks have been exhausted. Under this project scheme, surplus electricity will be generated at an average of 10 MW of electricity delivering approximately 77 GWh per year to the regional grid on a firm power, year-round basis. Of the 77 GWh to be exported to the grid annually, about 85 percent (65.45 GWh) will be generated directly from bagasse, with the balance from fuel oil during off-crop periods. In addition to the grid export, 58.8 GWh per year will be produced for internal use at the sugar mill.","","Carbon Finance","","Biomass"
